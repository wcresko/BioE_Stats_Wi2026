# T-tests, multiple testing & Chi-square tests

## Directions

**Assignment:** Your task is to use R and Quarto Markdown to write a short report including the tasks listed below. You will use some dataframes that you create, and a new data set studying the **effects of a drug treatment on bone regrowth in mice (`bone_healing.tsv`)**, as well as a small data table of cystic fibrosis patients. At the beginning of the Quarto file include a `data dictionary` for each of the variables in the datasets (as best as you can tell what they are), and be sure to load all of the packages at the beginning. Note that you'll need to use some of the Tidyverse tools that you learned previously, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to do the initial data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Due:** Submit your work via Canvas by the end of the day (midnight) on **Wednesday, February 4th at midnight** Please submit **both the Quarto_md file *and* the resulting html or pdf file**. You can work with other members of class, but I expect each of you to construct and run all of the scripts yourself.

## Exercise 2.1  - Re-sampling to create null distributions

1.  **Simulate a measured variable from a population of 10,000 organisms** Pretend that you are simulating the *entire population* of organisms, and that this variable is some normally distributed attribute of the organisms' physiology. To perform this simulation, draw 10,000 values from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2, and assign to a vector called `pop_physio`. In the real world, for non-simulated data, we don't know the population parameters, (we often want to estimate them), but in this case we are all-knowing! Be sure to set the random number generator seed to 234 at the beginning of your `R` code chunk. Also verify that the population mean and standard deviation are 10 and 2, respectively, using `R` functions on your `pop_physio` vector, plot a histogram of the distribution, and draw 3 vertical lines on the plot to show the mean and the mean +/- 1 standard deviation. Hint: check out the `abline()` function for the last part.

2.  **Take a single random sample of 100 values from your simulated population.** This will imitate the process of taking a sample from a population, similar to what happens when we conduct a study or experiment in the real world. Make sure to sample *without replacement*, and name your vector of sampled values `samp100_sizes`. Also remember to set the random number seed (again to 234) at the beginning of this code chunk. Now calculate the *sample mean* and *sample standard deviation*. These are *point estimates* for your population parameters. Make a plot of the distribution similar to the one above, but this time using `samp100_sizes`. Briefly comment on how similar the point estimates are to the known parameters.

3.  **Take 100 samples of 100 values each from your simulated population.** The idea here is to repeat the sampling process 100 times to look at the *sampling distributions* for mean and standard deviation, assuming a sample size of 100. Again, set the random number seed to 234 at the beginning of the code chunk, and take each sample from `pop_physio` *without replacement*. Name your matrix of 100 samples `repsamps_100`. Now plot the distribution of the sample mean and the distribution of the sample standard deviation. These will help you visualize how much variation in the point estimates there is across our 100 samples. Hint: you will need to calculate a sample mean and sample standard deviation for each of the 100 samples (columns of values) in `repsamps_100`, which can be accomplished with an `R` function from `dplyr`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercise 2.2 Parametric t-test in R on simulated dataset

1.  Using R to make a dummy data set that contains one continuous and one categorical value with two levels. To do so draw individuals of the two different factor levels from normal distributions (check the 'norm' family of functions) with slightly different means but equal standard deviations. Take 100 observations per factor level.

2.  Now, perform a t-test to see if the two populations are statistically different from one another (see below)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(continuous_variable~cat_variable, dataset name) 
t.test(continuous_variable~cat_variable, dataset name) 
```

3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 above but use different sample sizes (e.g. 10 , then 100, then 1000, then 10,000 obsv. per factor level). How does the sample size affect the statistics?

4.  What if you run the test again and make the means of the categorical groups more dissimilar?

5.  What happens if you change the standard deviation of your normal distributions to be very small or very large?

6.  Now perform the t-test using the dataset provided in class and your own data for two variables.

## Exercise 2.3: Goodness of Fit test for Cystic Fibrosis

## The Study

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. When both parents are carriers (genotype **Ff**), each child has the following expected probabilities:

-   25% chance of being homozygous dominant (**FF**) — unaffected, not a carrier

-   50% chance of being heterozygous (**Ff**) — unaffected carrier

-   25% chance of being homozygous recessive (**ff**) — affected by cystic fibrosis

A genetic counselor collects data from 377 children born to heterozygous carrier parents in a particular community and records the following distribution of genotypes:

| Genotype | Phenotype Status         | Observed Count |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------|
| FF       | Unaffected (not carrier) | 69             |
| Ff       | Carrier                  | 206            |
| ff       | Affected (CF)            | 102            |

The genetic counselor suspects that there might be divergence from expected Mendelian segregation ratios in this community due to some unmeasured environmental or genetic factors.

### Your Tasks:

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses for a Chi-square goodness of fit test to determine whether the observed genotypic distribution follows expected Mendelian segregation ratios.
2.  Calculate the **expected** counts for each genotype under the 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio by first calculating the allele frequencies in this population.
3.  Use R to perform the Chi-square goodness of fit test to compare the **expected genotype counts** to the **observed genotype counts**.
4.  Interpret your results in the context of Mendelian genetics. Use a significance level of α = 0.05.
5.  What would you recommend that the genetic counselor conclude about whether something else might be going on?

## Exercise 2.4: Chi-square contingency table analysis of successful regeneration

## The Study

A team of bioengineers is evaluating how **scaffold material** and **stem** **cell type** influence the success of tissue regeneration in a lab-grown cartilage model. They use three different scaffold materials and three types of stem cells and record whether the engineered cartilage shows successful regeneration (defined by a set of mechanical and histological markers) after 4 weeks.

They test the following materials

-   **Scaffold Materials:** 

    -   Collagen

    -   Hydrogel

    -   Bioceramic

-   **Stem Cell Types:** 

    -   Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC)

    -   Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSC)

    -   Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)

The counts below represent the **number of successful regenerations** out of **50 trials** for each combination of material and cell type.

|                | ASC     | BMSC    | iPSC    |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Collagen**   | 18 / 50 | 22 / 50 | 15 / 50 |
| **Hydrogel**   | 25 / 50 | 27 / 50 | 30 / 50 |
| **Bioceramic** | 20 / 50 | 23 / 50 | 21 / 50 |

### Your Tasks:

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.
2.  Using R, perform a Chi-square test of independence. Include the R code and output.
3.  Calculate the odds ratio and LOD score for just the collagen/hydrogel vs. ASC/BMSC combination.
4.  What do the results suggest? Use a significance level of α = 0.05.
5.  Would you conclude that scaffold type and cell type influence regeneration success independently, or do they interact?

## Exercise 2.5 Contingency test and Parametric t-test in R on `bone_healing.tsv` dataset

Say that you ran a pre-clinical trial to see of a mythical drug from Hogwarts (`bone-b-built`) using a number of different mice. The mice are either treated or control for the `bone-b-built` drug, and you measure two different classes of variables.

1.  Repeat the parametric t-test analyses that you performed in Exercise 2.2, but on the `bone_healing.tsv` dataset.
2.  Note that there are two different categories of response variables - whether the femur bone healed or not (bone_heal_binary), and the extent of growth of a femur bone (bone_growth_rate).
3.  You perform the experiment three different times, each time measuring if the bone healed and the femur growth rate. Note that these experiments are nearly identical to one another, with the amount of drug treatment being the same.

### Your Tasks:

1. Repeat the goodness-of-fit tests that you did previously to ask whether there is a difference between drug treated and control with respect to whether the bone heals or doesn't. Be sure to include appropriate plots and odds ratios to show effect size.
2. Repeat the parametric t-test analyses that you performed above, but on the `bone_healing.tsv` dataset.
3. Note that you will be performing the tests in 1. three times, and 2. three times. Create a table of original and adjusted p-values given that you did multiple testing using the three different adjustment measures that we learned in class.
