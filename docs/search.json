    "text": "Assignment: Your task is to use R and Quarto Markdown to write a short report including the tasks listed below. You will use some dataframes that you create, and a new data set studying the effects of a drug treatment on bone regrowth in mice (bone_healing.tsv), as well as a small data table of cystic fibrosis patients. At the beginning of the Quarto file include a data dictionary for each of the variables in the datasets (as best as you can tell what they are), and be sure to load all of the packages at the beginning. Note that you’ll need to use some of the Tidyverse tools that you learned previously, including dplyr and ggplot2 to do the initial data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA).\nDue: Submit your work via Canvas by the end of the day (midnight) on Wednesday, February 4th at midnight Please submit both the Quarto_md file and the resulting html or pdf file. You can work with other members of class, but I expect each of you to construct and run all of the scripts yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulate a measured variable from a population of 10,000 organisms Pretend that you are simulating the entire population of organisms, and that this variable is some normally distributed attribute of the organisms’ physiology. To perform this simulation, draw 10,000 values from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2, and assign to a vector called pop_physio. In the real world, for non-simulated data, we don’t know the population parameters, (we often want to estimate them), but in this case we are all-knowing! Be sure to set the random number generator seed to 234 at the beginning of your R code chunk. Also verify that the population mean and standard deviation are 10 and 2, respectively, using R functions on your pop_physio vector, plot a histogram of the distribution, and draw 3 vertical lines on the plot to show the mean and the mean +/- 1 standard deviation. Hint: check out the abline() function for the last part.\nTake a single random sample of 100 values from your simulated population. This will imitate the process of taking a sample from a population, similar to what happens when we conduct a study or experiment in the real world. Make sure to sample without replacement, and name your vector of sampled values samp100_sizes. Also remember to set the random number seed (again to 234) at the beginning of this code chunk. Now calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation. These are point estimates for your population parameters. Make a plot of the distribution similar to the one above, but this time using samp100_sizes. Briefly comment on how similar the point estimates are to the known parameters.\nTake 100 samples of 100 values each from your simulated population. The idea here is to repeat the sampling process 100 times to look at the sampling distributions for mean and standard deviation, assuming a sample size of 100. Again, set the random number seed to 234 at the beginning of the code chunk, and take each sample from pop_physio without replacement. Name your matrix of 100 samples repsamps_100. Now plot the distribution of the sample mean and the distribution of the sample standard deviation. These will help you visualize how much variation in the point estimates there is across our 100 samples. Hint: you will need to calculate a sample mean and sample standard deviation for each of the 100 samples (columns of values) in repsamps_100, which can be accomplished with an R function from dplyr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing R to make a dummy data set that contains one continuous and one categorical value with two levels. To do so draw individuals of the two different factor levels from normal distributions (check the ‘norm’ family of functions) with slightly different means but equal standard deviations. Take 100 observations per factor level.\nNow, perform a t-test to see if the two populations are statistically different from one another (see below)\n\n\nboxplot(continuous_variable~cat_variable, dataset name) \nt.test(continuous_variable~cat_variable, dataset name) \n\n\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 above but use different sample sizes (e.g. 10 , then 100, then 1000, then 10,000 obsv. per factor level). How does the sample size affect the statistics?\nWhat if you run the test again and make the means of the categorical groups more dissimilar?\nWhat happens if you change the standard deviation of your normal distributions to be very small or very large?\nNow perform the t-test using the dataset provided in class and your own data for two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. When both parents are carriers (genotype Ff), each child has the following expected probabilities:\n\n25% chance of being homozygous dominant (FF) — unaffected, not a carrier\n50% chance of being heterozygous (Ff) — unaffected carrier\n25% chance of being homozygous recessive (ff) — affected by cystic fibrosis\n\nA genetic counselor collects data from 377 children born to heterozygous carrier parents in a particular community and records the following distribution of genotypes:\n\n\n\nGenotype\nPhenotype Status\nObserved Count\n\n\n\n\nFF\nUnaffected (not carrier)\n69\n\n\nFf\nCarrier\n206\n\n\nff\nAffected (CF)\n102\n\n\n\nThe genetic counselor suspects that there might be divergence from expected Mendelian segregation ratios in this community due to some unmeasured environmental or genetic factors.\n\n\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses for a Chi-square goodness of fit test to determine whether the observed genotypic distribution follows expected Mendelian segregation ratios.\nCalculate the expected counts for each genotype under the 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio by first calculating the allele frequencies in this population.\nUse R to perform the Chi-square goodness of fit test to compare the expected genotype counts to the observed genotype counts.\nInterpret your results in the context of Mendelian genetics. Use a significance level of α = 0.05.\nWhat would you recommend that the genetic counselor conclude about whether something else might be going on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of bioengineers is evaluating how scaffold material and stem cell type influence the success of tissue regeneration in a lab-grown cartilage model. They use three different scaffold materials and three types of stem cells and record whether the engineered cartilage shows successful regeneration (defined by a set of mechanical and histological markers) after 4 weeks.\nThey test the following materials\n\nScaffold Materials: \n\nCollagen\nHydrogel\nBioceramic\n\nStem Cell Types: \n\nAdipose-derived stem cells (ASC)\nBone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSC)\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)\n\n\nThe counts below represent the number of successful regenerations out of 50 trials for each combination of material and cell type.\n\n\n\n\nASC\nBMSC\niPSC\n\n\n\n\nCollagen\n18 / 50\n22 / 50\n15 / 50\n\n\nHydrogel\n25 / 50\n27 / 50\n30 / 50\n\n\nBioceramic\n20 / 50\n23 / 50\n21 / 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.\nUsing R, perform a Chi-square test of independence. Include the R code and output.\nCalculate the odds ratio and LOD score for just the collagen/hydrogel vs. ASC/BMSC combination.\nWhat do the results suggest? Use a significance level of α = 0.05.\nWould you conclude that scaffold type and cell type influence regeneration success independently, or do they interact?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay that you ran a pre-clinical trial to see of a mythical drug from Hogwarts (bone-b-built) using a number of different mice. The mice are either treated or control for the bone-b-built drug, and you measure two different classes of variables.\n\nRepeat the parametric t-test analyses that you performed in Exercise 2.2, but on the bone_healing.tsv dataset.\nNote that there are two different categories of response variables - whether the femur bone healed or not (bone_heal_binary), and the extent of growth of a femur bone (bone_growth_rate).\nYou perform the experiment three different times, each time measuring if the bone healed and the femur growth rate. Note that these experiments are nearly identical to one another, with the amount of drug treatment being the same.\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the goodness-of-fit tests that you did previously to ask whether there is a difference between drug treated and control with respect to whether the bone heals or doesn’t. Be sure to include appropriate plots and odds ratios to show effect size.\nRepeat the parametric t-test analyses that you performed above, but on the bone_healing.tsv dataset.\nNote that you will be performing the tests in 1. three times, and 2. three times. Create a table of original and adjusted p-values given that you did multiple testing using the three different adjustment measures that we learned in class."

Students should carefully follow the detailed instructions associated with each assignment. Students are encouraged to work together and share information. In particular, some students will have a higher skill level than others, and we encourage those students with more experience to help their peers. However, no direct sharing of code is allowed.\nPreparing and submitting assignments: Assignments will be submitted on Canvas in the form of Quarto files, with the rendered html output. Be sure to include your name on the document. Be professional – appropriately name your files, make sure they are organized, and submit only the information requested. Late assignments will not be accepted.\n\nGrading\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage of Total Grade\n\n\n\n\nProblem Sets - 4 in total, 20% each\n80%\n\n\nTerm-long Projects\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade Percentage\nLetter Grade\nPass/No Pass Grade\n\n\n\n\n100% - 90%\nA\nPass\n\n\n89% - 80%\nB\nPass\n\n\n79% - 80%\nC\nNo Pass\n\n\n69% - 60%\nD\nNo Pass\n\n\n60% - 0%\nF\nNo Pass"

The end of many class periods will also function as a form of office hour.\nI welcome meetings outside my regular office hours as well - please email me to set a time.\nDuring office hours, students bring in a wide range of concerns, questions, and successes. We might\n\ntalk through a specific concept or problem to clarify it\nthink together about an issue a student is curious about that relates to the class\ndiscuss a student’s post-graduation goals\nidentify more supportive methods to study for a future exam or to begin a project\nor any number of other topics"

This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups, and working collaboratively on coding projects. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.\n\n\nExpect and Respect Diversity\nAll classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.\n\n\nHelp Everyone Learn\nPart of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better."

We will discuss during the first week how GenAI can be a tool to help you, but it cannot replace your statistical intuition and knowledge. However, you cannot use content such as text, graphics and code created by GenAI tools in your work. You must be the author/creator of your work submissions. For example, you can use a GenAI tool to suggest a paper outline based on a draft you provide it, or suggest some code, but you cannot submit a paper with text or code generated by GenAI as if the text or code is your own writing. If you are in doubt or have questions about a particular GenAI tool and if its use is okay, check in with me and let’s discuss!"
