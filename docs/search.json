In this experiment two different genotypes of stickleback (ocean and freshwater) were tested by subjecting each to two different microbiome treatments (conventional or mono-associated). Stickleback can be made germ free and then either exposed to the conventional microbiome or just one microbe. After exposure the guts were extracted, RNA isolated, and RNAseq data collected.\nThe dataset (igf.tsv) can be found in the data folder on Canvas. This dataset has the following variables:\n\nGenotype - whether the fish has an oceanic or freshwater genotype\nMicrobiota - whether the fish was germ free or conventionalized\nFGF3 - the level of gene expression of the signalling molecule Fibroblast Growth Factor 3\nSox10 - the level of gene expression of the transcription factor gene Sox10\nSLC5 - the level of gene expression of the small molecule transporter SLC5\n\nIs R correctly interpreting the class of your variables?

    "text": "Problem 3 - a priori power analyses via simulation\nYou have been asked by your colleagues to aid in the design of an experiment to determine how many mice might be needed to test the efficacy of a specific medical device on bone growth. The in vivo trials are expensive, and so the researchers would like your help to figure out how many mice are needed to achieve a reasonable level of precision. In particular, they are interested in both the number of microns that bones grow over a 3 month period, and whether mice that have the implant have a greater rate of growth than those that do not.\nTo help them, you should do a power analysis, and write up the results in a short, readable section. Your colleagues will be interested in the cost-precision tradeoff, so you should include graphical displays that convey both (a) how accurately the mean number microns of growth can be estimated, and (b) how likely it is that a real difference in mean between treated and control of a given, reasonable size will be detected (have a \\(p\\)-value less than 0.05), both as a function of sample size. I’m leaving it up to you precisely how to convey these things.\nI’d like you to do this power analysis using simulation: by using the computer to do the experiment in silico in the case where you know the truth, and seeing how close your estimates are to the truth. To do this, you’ll have to make some stuff up: for instance, plausible values for what the mean growth rate is, and what sort of mean difference between the treated and control that your colleagues might plausibly care about. You don’t have to do independent research to find good values, but you should discuss the choices you made. You will also have to decide what a good range of sample sizes is to display your results across. I’ll save you the burden of making one thing up: you can assume that the distribution of distances traveled is Poisson distributed, so you can simulate your fake surveys using the function rpois( ). Your final report for this section should be readable and not include visible code in the compiled version. However, you should explain clearly in words what you did to arrive at your answers.\nThe purposes of this section of the homework are to practice writing reports in Quarto markdown; doing simulation-based power analyses, and communicating results in plain language."

    "text": "Classroom Community Expectations\n\nParticipate and Contribute:\nAll students are expected to participate by sharing ideas and contributing to the learning environment. This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups, and working collaboratively on coding projects. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.\n\n\nExpect and Respect Diversity\nAll classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.\n\n\nHelp Everyone Learn\nPart of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better."

However, you cannot use content such as text, graphics and code created by GenAI tools in your work. You must be the author/creator of your work submissions. For example, you can use a GenAI tool to suggest a paper outline based on a draft you provide it, or suggest some code, but you cannot submit a paper with text or code generated by GenAI as if the text or code is your own writing. If you are in doubt or have questions about a particular GenAI tool and if its use is okay, check in with me and let’s discuss!"

    "text": "Problem 3.1 : Factorial ANOVA of Flu and Immune Response\n\nThe Study\nYou are working with a group studying immune response to different types of seasonal flu. From a large number of blood samples from people with the flu but otherwise healthy, the group has determined for each person the strain of flu, the strength of the immune response (in units of pg/mL of interleukin-1β), and the person’s genotype at an immune-regulating gene. The group is interested in a fine-scale classification of flu, so they have divided the flu samples up into a fairly large number of distinct strains. The main question they are interested in is whether the mean strength of immune response (measured using interleukin-1β concentration) differs by flu strains. Next they are interested in which strains (if any) tend to induce stronger, or weaker, responses. Of course, they would like to know how any differences compare to natural variation in immune response. In previous studies, mean immune response differed by genotype of the immune-regulating gene, so the analysis should take this into account. You should look at the data, then answer these questions using a multifactor ANOVA. In particular, you should examine both whether there is an effect of flu strain and whether that effect depends on person’s genotype (i.e., if there are significant interaction effects). Your report should explain, in your own words, how each analysis works what the conclusions are, and what to conclude after looking at both sets of results.\nThe dataset (flu.tsv) can be found in the data folder on Canvas. This dataset has the following variables\n\nid\nstrain of the flu virus\ngenotype of the individual\nresponse in terms of interleukin-1β\n\nThe data are available on Canvas. Note: this is fake data; for real information on flu strains see nextflu.org.\n\n\nYour Tasks:\n\nFit and interpret the ANOVA model.\nMake an interaction plot for this question: the x-axis should show the various flu strains; the y-axis should show immune response, and there should be one line for each genotype, connecting the mean response to each flu strain for people of that genotype. The plot should show not just the means, but also the range of variation in the data.\nCreate a combined variable of the two factor variables and perform a Tukey’s post-hoc means test, as well as one a priori test of your choice."
